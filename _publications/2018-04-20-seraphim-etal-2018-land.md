The policy of urban land regularization in Brazil has it legal basis expressed in the Estatuto da Cidade, Federal Law no. 11,481/2001. This norm contemplates a multidimensional understanding of the conditions necessary for the integration of illegal settlements into the formal city. It goes beyond the granting of land title, since it establishes that the urban, environmental and social dimensions are also taken into account in the regularization projects. Thus, quality of life and environmental quality aspects are expected to be present in the regulated areas, this is not verified by official surveys, where basic service deficiency and environmental impacts are identified. The present study aims to objectify the evaluation of the projects, verifying which elements contribute to the urban and environmental spatial qualification, allowing a qualified feedback to the projects. As method, was explored elements that compose the regularization projects in the different dimensions and reviewed concepts of quality of life and environmental quality to identify elements that characterize them. An evaluation framework was organized and used to analyze a project considered a successful example, the Cantinho do Céu, in an area of ​​Protection and Recovery of Water Supplies in the city of São Paulo. It was possible to verify how the implemented interventions relate with the regularization dimensions defined in law and with the guarantors of quality of life and environmental quality. Emphasis was placed on what is defined as quality of life, despite having a proportionality between the environmental, social and urban dimensions, which explains its success.
