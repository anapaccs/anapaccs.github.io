The article aims to contribute to the study of urban form and hydrological impacts relations, especially with regard to a recharge of the aquifers. The focus on the natural water infiltration and recharge of aquifers is due to the similarities between the characteristics of the physical environment conducive to aquifer recharge and urbanization, which lead to urban occupation of recharge areas. To address the proposed objective, the study developed a methodological framework that relates elements of the urban form, intervening factors of urban infiltration and water sensitive urban design guidelines. To accomplish this, recent literature were reviewed in urban drainage, water-sensitive urbanism and urban morphology, seeking to organize and identify the links between them. The intervening factors of natural infiltration found in the literature were: (i) Sealing of the soil; (ii) soil compaction; and (iii) reduction of tree cover. The urban morphological elements related to these factors were: (i) streets; (ii) public spaces; and (iii) lots. The analysis characteristics of each of these morphological elements were identified from the revised intervening factors and urban design guidelines. The use of the framework for the analysis of the Lago Paranoá Basin in the DF – Distrito Federal, Brazil, demonstrated the validity of the identified analysis criteria for the study of the urban form hydrological impact. In addition, it confirmed the premise of the study that more details about the urban occupation form are needed, besides the percentage of impervious surfaces, for the evaluation and planning of water sensitive cities.
