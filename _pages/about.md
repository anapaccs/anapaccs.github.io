I am a happy and passionate young professional specializing in the complex relationships between nature and cities and their integral role in sustainable development. With over five years of experience in urban and regional development and public policy across intergovernmental, national, and local contexts, I have honed excellent communication, leadership, and client engagement skills. Complementing my technical background, I have conducted academic research at the Master's and PhD levels for more than 5 years. This experience equipped me to independently plan and execute long projects and explore complex social, environmental, and economics issues using advanced quantitative and qualitative analysis methods.
