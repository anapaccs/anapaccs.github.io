This norm contemplates a multidimensional understanding of the conditions necessary for the integration of illegal settlements into the formal city. It goes beyond the granting of land title, since it establishes that the urban, environmental and social dimensions are also taken into account in the regularization projects. Thus, quality of life and environmental quality aspects are expected to be present in the regulated areas, this is not verified by official surveys, where basic service deficiency and environmental impacts are identified. The present study aims to objectify the evaluation of the projects, verifying which elements contribute to the urban and environmental spatial qualification, allowing a qualified feedback to the projects. As method, was explored elements that compose the regularization projects in the different dimensions and reviewed concepts of quality of life and environmental quality to identify elements that characterize them. An evaluation framework was organized and used to analyze a project considered a successful example, the Cantinho do Céu, in an area of ​​Protection and Recovery of Water Supplies in the city of São Paulo. It was possible to verify how the implemented interventions relate with the regularization dimensions defined in law and with the guarantors of quality of life and environmental quality. Emphasis was placed on what is defined as quality of life, despite having a proportionality between the environmental, social and urban dimensions, which explains its success.		inproceedings	seraphim-etal-2018-land	2018		10.4995/ISUF2017.2017.6074 		
2019-01-01	Implication of Urban Occupation Patterns in the Natural Infiltration	Ana Paula A.C.C. Seraphim, Maria L. Bezerra, Aline N. Oliveira	Proceedings of the Fábos Conference on Landscape and Greenway Planning		Seraphim, Ana Paula A.C.C.; Bezerra, Maria L.; and Oliveira, Aline N. (2019) "Implication of Urban Occupation Patterns in the Natural Infiltration," Proceedings of the Fábos Conference on Landscape and Greenway Planning: Vol. 6: Iss. 1, Article 22. 	seraphim-etal-2019-implication	https://scholarworks.umass.edu/fabos/vol6/iss1/22/	The article aims to contribute to the study of urban form and hydrological impacts relations, especially with regard to a recharge of the aquifers. The focus on the natural water infiltration and recharge of aquifers is due to the similarities between the characteristics of the physical environment conducive to aquifer recharge and urbanization, which lead to urban occupation of recharge areas. To address the proposed objective, the study developed a methodological framework that relates elements of the urban form, intervening factors of urban infiltration and water sensitive urban design guidelines. To accomplish this, recent literature were reviewed in urban drainage, water-sensitive urbanism and urban morphology, seeking to organize and identify the links between them. The intervening factors of natural infiltration found in the literature were: (i) Sealing of the soil; (ii) soil compaction; and (iii) reduction of tree cover. The urban morphological elements related to these factors were: (i) streets; (ii) public spaces; and (iii) lots. The analysis characteristics of each of these morphological elements were identified from the revised intervening factors and urban design guidelines. The use of the framework for the analysis of the Lago Paranoá Basin in the DF – Distrito Federal, Brazil, demonstrated the validity of the identified analysis criteria for the study of the urban form hydrological impact. In addition, it confirmed the premise of the study that more details about the urban occupation form are needed, besides the percentage of impervious surfaces, for the evaluation and planning of water sensitive cities.		article	seraphim-etal-2019-implication	2019		10.7275/n9kf-cr53	6	1
